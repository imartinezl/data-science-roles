Title: Analysis of current roles in data science using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

Description:

Data science is large topic, and it is often accompanied by other words such as "machine learning", "big data", "artificial intelligence", "business analytics" or "data mining". During the last years the world of data science has evolved very rapidly, and has come to develop abilities that few years ago were thought to be almost imposible. These latest technical achievements in the field of data science have created high expectations both in academics and industry, which have created a lot of new opportunities around data science, and also new jobs.

But as with any new and evolving field, data science has taken in professionals from very wide and different backgrounds, such as computer science, mathematics and statistics. Back in the early days of data science, the education programs were hardly updated, and few of the people working under the name "data scientists" had been properly trained for it. As the field has evolved, so have done the job positions. Nowadays, there are lots of different roles and the naming is usually confusing. What is a data scientist? What are its responsabilities on a data science project? What skills are necessary for the job? But also, it could be interesting to know the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst. Or what about a data engineer, a machine learning engineer, a business intelligence engineer or a business analyst. As you can see, the landscape of data science roles is very wide and complex.

In this project, we would like to analyze the current roles in data science by using a data driven approach. The main goal of the project is to develop
